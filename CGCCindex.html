		The Backstory:
		<p>
      Her Royal Highness Princess Maya is a seven year old English bulldog adopted from the Houston Bulldog Rescue last August. She and her brother Nathan, who we unfortunately had to put down in December, were given up by their previus owner, most likely due to medical problems. Maya had cherry eye, an infecteionin her tear duct,  in both eyes, Nathan had it in one. Both dogs were extremely overweight,Maya weighed twice what she should, and Nathan also had a tumor on his chest, which was removed and came back much bigger,which was why we had to put him down.At this point in time,they were known as Lolah and Tank.The rescue renamed them Edith and Archie.We then adopted them and inturduced her to our dog,Sam. Maya and Sam got along fine, Sam and Nathan were not overly fond of each other at first,but eventully they became freinds.
